/*
# Employee delete with soft-delete fallback and Super Admin cascade

1. New Function
- `delete_employee_profile(p_token, p_code, p_force)` returns one of:
  - 'deleted': the profile (and its linked login account) was removed.
  - 'resigned': the profile has attendance, schedule, leave or payroll data, so it was soft deleted. Status is set to resigned and the linked account is deactivated.
  - 'has_data': Super Admin tried to delete a profile with data without confirming. Nothing changed.

2. Rules
- Super Admin: deletes the profile. With p_force = true and data present, every attendance, schedule, leave carry-over and payroll row for the employee is deleted first (cascade), then the linked login account and the profile.
- Hotel Admin and Manager (mod): only employees of their own hotels. With data present the profile is soft deleted; without data it is removed.
- Staff cannot call the function.
- The whole operation runs in one transaction, so a failure leaves nothing half-deleted.

3. Security
- The function checks the caller's session token and hotel scope.
- Direct browser DELETE on `employees` is revoked and its delete policy dropped, so profile removal only goes through this function.

4. Important Notes
- A payroll period that is locked by the database may still block deletion of its rows; the error is returned rather than bypassed.
